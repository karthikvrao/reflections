What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google

    -more control

    cons:
    -may forget to commit often

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    VCS like git are generally used for coding and related activities that span multiple files as a LUW while google docs are generally independent files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
